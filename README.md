# PLPTivnanTwomey
This repository contains the final project for the Programming Languages Principles class for Liam Twomey and Dylan Tivnan. This project creates a small functional language called let lang in Java. Let Lang has a syntax that that was decided upon by the members of the group. Let lang supports: mathematic functions, let statements, multiple let statements, lists, sets, relational operations, if statements, n-way selection, boolean operations, lambda expressions and functions. The files found in this repository are all the files necessary to run let-lang, including the code itself as well as the build and all the test cases for each feature of let lang. This project was gradually added onto for an entire semester, culminating in this project.
